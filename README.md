# Blue-gecko-BGM113-or-BGM121-blinky
This is frankestein bodge that allows programming C code for BGM113 or BGM121 (any of the Blue Gecko series). By default in Simplicity studio 4.0 there are no examples in C (for ARM GCC compier). This solves that problem

I will write instructions on how to set Simplicity studio to use ARM GCC compilet to write programs in a few days
